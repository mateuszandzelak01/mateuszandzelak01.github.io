									<h1>My short story</h1>

								<div class="image main"><img src="images/roadlife.jfif" alt="" /></div>
								<p>My name is Mateusz and I am a husband and father of two children, Filip and Kasia. 
									For the last 8 years, I have been professionally involved in the real estate market, both as a property manager and a private investor. 
								Since 2015, I have been working as a consultant and project manager related to the implementation of the ERP system for property management companies.
									On a daily basis, I deal with pre-implementation analyzes, take part in database conversion from previous systems, conduct training and consultations for clients.
									From 2018, I started to read more and more on topics related to the broadly understood AI and BIG DATA, 
									which resulted in participation in a half-year course on Data Science. After completing the course,
									I tried to find a job as a Junior Data Scientist, unfortunately to no avail. 
								<p>After two years, I decided to give myself a chance again, this time in a slightly different role, but still related to the data. 
									The DATA ANALYST PORTFOLIO website was created not only so that I could show it on my CV, 
									but also to be able to fulfill myself in the field of data science, which I do not hide, always fascinated me in a way, 
									but I have never had the opportunity to develop professionally in this direction.</p>
								<p>	By writing this description, I hope that in the near future it will change and I will have to update the post :)</p>
